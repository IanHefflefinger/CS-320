# CS-320
Repository for CS-320-T3224 Software Test Automation&amp; QA 21EW3 (SNHU)

This repo contains the project we have worked on throughout this course. It includes a simple application that creates objects (appointments, tasks, and contacts) and adds those objects to lists. Alongside the application, are Junit tests I wrote for verifying and validating.
